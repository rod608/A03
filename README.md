*Git, GitHub, WebStorm*

*Git & Github*

I use Git in the command line, so the steps are as followed for me: 
1. Go to github.com and create a new repository
2. Copy the HTTPS Quick Setup link shown within the repo, still on github.com.
3. From here, head to the console.
4. Use the *cd* command to navigate to your existing or new project's main folder.
5. From within the console, type the following without quotations: In the console: Type “git remote add origin *QuickSetupLinkHere*”.
6. Follow w/ “git push -u origin master” to push to Github. Sometimes a regular "git push" is enough though.
7. Check GitHub to ensure everything has been added.

This process can be applied using any IDE, as the terminal is your medium.

*General Knowledge*
1. Webstorm is an IDE that specializes in web development.
2. Git is a version control system, allowing for project versions/snapshots & collaborative work.
3. I can access my Webstorm projects using Git; I prefer do this through the terminal rather than the built-in VCS way.
4. For now, I'll be adding only HTML & CSS files to my Webstorm projects, with the extensions being .html & .css respectively.

*Vocabulary*

* **Branch**: A set of related code changes within a project; projects can have multiple.

* **Clone**: Copy a GitHub Repository onto your local computer.

* **Commit**: A snapshot of your repository.

* **Fetch**: Retrieve newly completed work done by other people.

* **GIT**: Open-source version control system; useful for tracking changes within a project through snapshots, and working collaboratively.

* **Github**: Internet-hosted website that serves the purpose of offering GIT's version control functionality as well as its own features.

* **Merge**: Merge different people's work with yours.

* **Merge Conflict**: When two different branches make edits to the same line in a file or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other. Most common in team-related environments.

* **Push**: Updates the specified branch with local commits. Only updates corresponding branch.

* **Pull**: A combination of fetch & merge.

* **Remote**: Allows for creating, viewing, & deleting connections to other repositories; sort of like bookmarking.

* **Repository**: A type of database that stores our code in this scenario. Typically used to store metadata in larger projects.
