*Git, GitHub, WebStorm*
I use Git in the command line, so the steps are as followed for me: 
1. Go to github.com and create a new repository
2. Copy the HTTPS Quick Setup link shown within the repo, still on github.com.
3. From here, head to the console.
4. Use the *cd* command to navigate to your existing or new project's main folder.
5. From within the console, type the following without quotations: In the console: Type “git remote add origin *QuickSetupLinkHere*”.
6. Follow w/ “git push -u origin master” to push to Github.
7. Check GitHub to ensure everything has been added.
